# boundaryless-eam-with-semantic-web-tools
Slides for "Boundaryless EAM with Semantic Web Tools" presentation at The Open Group London April 2016

Abstract:

In 2015 Kuehne + Nagel initiated a project together with the University of Hamburg (ITMC department) to evaluate semantic web tools for Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM).
For the evaluation, a business demand from contract logistics was selected. The goal is to optimize the incident management for IT failures in the warehouse and transport management process. An ontology was defined that combines information from the extended enterprise (partners and customers) with information from different enterprise architecture domains, like warehouses, business and IT organization structures, application components, infrastructure devices and severity definitions. Data for a selected use case is stored in an RDF database and analyzed for different incident cases with a modern web user interface (AngularJS, Bootstrap) and SPARQL queries.
The presentation will give a short introduction of the relevant semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and how they relate to the information management for enterprise architecture. We will show what semantic web tools we selected with the applied selection criteria’s. For the ontology modeling Protégé is used. We will present the OWL2 ontology in Protégé and discuss the experiences that we made during ontology design so far. We will also talk about the integration of data from EAM tools. Finally we will show a demo of the evaluation prototype.
The presentation will conclude with a summary of our experiences and an overview of our evaluation results. We will give some information where we are at this point in time and give an outlook of our future plans for Enterprise Architecture and Linked Data.

Key takeaways:
- Learn about semantic web technologies and how they can support enterprise architecture management
- Get insides how these technologies can be used to manage information of the extended enterprise
- See how these technologies can be used to optimize your IT service management
